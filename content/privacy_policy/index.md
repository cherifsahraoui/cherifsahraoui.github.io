## II. General Information on Data Processing

### 1. Scope of Processing Personal Data

We process personal data of our users only to the extent necessary to provide a
functional website as well as our content and services. The processing of
personal data of our users is generally carried out only with the consent of the
user. An exception applies in cases where obtaining prior consent is not
possible for factual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by
legal provisions.

### 2. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data

If we obtain consent from the data subject for processing personal data, Art. 6
(1) lit. a of the GDPR serves as the legal basis.  
When processing personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to
which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 (1) lit. b of the GDPR serves as the
legal basis. This also applies to processing activities required for the
performance of pre-contractual measures.  
If processing personal data is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation to which
our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) lit. c of the GDPR serves as the legal basis.  
In cases where the processing of personal data is necessary to protect the vital
interests of the data subject or another natural person, Art. 6 (1) lit. d of
the GDPR serves as the legal basis.

If the processing is necessary for the protection of a legitimate interest of
our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms
of the data subject do not override the first-mentioned interest, Art. 6 (1)
lit. f of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.

### 3. Data Deletion and Storage Duration

Personal data of data subjects will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose
of the storage no longer applies. Further storage may occur if required by
European or national legislations, regulations, or other provisions to which the
responsible entity is subject.

### 2. Legal Basis for Data Processing
